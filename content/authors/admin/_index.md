Alex Ludwig is an assistant professor of liberal arts at Berklee College of Music. I teach a variety of courses in music history, including topics in Rock History, Viennese Modernism, and Film Music. In addition, I catalogue examples of film that include musical references to the gregorian chant, "Dies Irae."  

When I'm not in the classroom, I enjoy playing and coaching soccer, watching hockey, and studying movie musicals.
